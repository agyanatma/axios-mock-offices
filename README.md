- You have to use:
  - [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/docs/react/overview) to fetch data from an API (in this case, you will fetch from mocked data that we already provided)
  - [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started) to manage a form such as input state, submitting, and form validation
- Allowed to use a Component library (Material UI, etc), CSS Framework (Tailwind, etc), or Vanilla CSS
